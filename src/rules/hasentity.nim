## The rule to check if the selected module has the selected entities, like
## procedures, constants, etc. with the selected names. The syntax in a
## configuration file is::
##
##   [ruleType] ?not? hasentity [entityType] [entityName] ?parentEntity? ?childIndex?
##
## * ruleType is the type of rule which will be executed. Proper values are:
##   *check*, *search* and *count*. For more information about the types of
##   rules, please refer to the program's documentation. Check type will raise
##   an error if the selected type of entity with the selected name was not
##   found in the module. Search type will list all entities of the selected
##   type with the selected name and raise error if nothing was found. Count
##   type will simply list the amount of the selected entities.
## * optional word *not* means negation for the rule. For example, if rule is
##   set to check for procedures named myProc, adding word *not* will change
##   to inform only about modules without the procedure with that name.
## * hasentity is the name of the rule. It is case-insensitive, thus it can be
##   set as *hasentity*, *hasEntity* or *hAsEnTiTy*.
## * entityType is the type of entity which will be looking for. Proper values
##   are types used by Nim compiler, defined in file compiler/ast.nim in
##   enumeration *TNodeKind*. Examples: *nkType*, *nkCall*.
## * entityName is the name of entity which will be looking for. The rule
##   search for the selected entity type, which name starts with entityName.
##   For example, if entityType is set to nkProcDef and entityName is set to
##   *myProc* the rule will find procedures named *myProc*, but also *myProcedure*.
## * if optional parameter *parentEntity* is set then the entity will be searched
##   only as a child of the selected type of entities. For example setting
##   entityType to nkProcDef, entityName to myProc and parentEntity to nkStmtList
##   will find all nested procedures with name *myProc* or *myProcedure*.
## * if optional parameter *childIndex* is set, then the entity will be searched
##   only as the selected child of the selected parent. In order for
##   `*childIndex` parameter to work, the parameter *parentEntity* must be set
##   too. If the value of the *childIndex* is a natural number, it is the index of
##   the child counted from the beginning of the list of children. If the value is
##   negative, it is the index of the child counted from the end of the list of
##   children.
##
## To look only for global entities, add `*` to the end of the entityName
## parameter. Setting it to *MyProc\** will look only for global entities
## which full name is MyProc.
##
## Note
## ----
##
## hasEntity rule is considered as a low level rule. It requires a
## knowledge about Nim compiler, especially names of the Nim code nodes and the
## generated source code tree to use. It is recommended to use other rules
## instead of this one.
##
## Disabling the rule
## ------------------
## It is possible to disable the rule for a selected part of the checked code
## by using pragma *ruleOff: "hasEntity"* before the code's fragment which
## shouldn't be checked.
##
## To enable the rule again, the pragma *ruleOn: "hasEntity"* should be added
## before the code which should be checked.
##
## Examples
## --------
##
## 1. Check if module has declared global procedure with name *myProc*::
##
##     check hasEntity nkProcDef myProc*
##
## 2. Search for all defined global constants::
##
##     search hasEntity nkConstSection *
##
## 3. Count the amount of global enumerations::
##
##     count hasEntiry nkEnumTy *
##
## 4. Check if there are no declarations of global range types::
##
##     check not hasEntity nkRange *
