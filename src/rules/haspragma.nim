## The rule to check if the selected procedure has the selected pragma. The
## syntax in a configuration file is::
##
##   [ruleType] ?not? haspragma [entityType] [listOfPragmas]
##
## * ruleType is the type of rule which will be executed. Proper values are:
##   *check*, *search* and *count*. For more information about the types of
##   rules, please refer to the program's documentation. Check rule will
##   looking for procedures with declaration of the selected list of pragmas
##   and list all of them which doesn't have them, raising error either. Search
##   rule will look for the procedures with the selected pragmas and list
##   all of them which have the selected pragmas, raising error if nothing is
##   found.  Count type will simply list the amount of the procedures with the
##   selected pragmas.
## * optional word *not* means negation for the rule. For example, if rule is
##   set to check for pragma SideEffect, adding word *not* will change
##   to inform only about procedures with that pragma.
## * haspragma is the name of the rule. It is case-insensitive, thus it can be
##   set as *haspragma*, *hasPragma* or *hAsPrAgMa*.
## * entityType is the type of code's entity which will be checked for the
##   selected pragmas. Possible values: `procedures`: check all procedures,
##   functions and methods. `templates`: check templates only. `all`: check
##   all routines declarations (procedures, functions, templates, macros, etc.).
## * listOfPragmas is the list of pragmas for which the rule will be looking
##   for. Each pragma must be separated with whitespace, like::
##
##     SideEffect gcSafe
##
## It is possible to use shell's like globing in setting the names of the
## pragmas. If the sign `*` is at the start of the pragma name, it means to
## look for procedures which have pragmas ending with that string. For example,
## `*Effect` will find procedures with pragma *SideEffect* but not
## *sideeffect* or *effectPragma*. If sign `*` is at the end of the pragma
## name, it means to look for procedures which have pragmas starting
## with that string. For example, `raises: [*` will find procedures with
## pragma *raises: []* or *raises: [Exception]* but not `myCustomraises: [custom]`.
## If the name of the pragma starts and ends with sign `*`, it means to look
## for procedures which have pragmas containing the string. For example, `*Exception*`
## will find `raises: [MyException]` or `myCustomExceptionRaise`.
##
## The list of pragmas must be in the form of console line arguments:
##
## 1. Each pragma name must be separated with whitespace: `myPragma otherPragma`
## 2. If the search string contains whitespace, it must be enclosed in quotes
##    or escaped, like in the console line arguments: `"mypragma: [" otherPragma`
## 3. All other special characters must be escaped as in a console line
##    arguments: `stringWith\"QuoteSign`
##
## Disabling the rule
## ------------------
## It is possible to disable the rule for a selected part of the checked code
## by using pragma *ruleOff: "hasPragma"* in the element from which the rule
## should be disabled. For example, if the rule should be disabled for procedure
## `main()`, the full declaration of it should be::
##
##      proc main() {.ruleOff: "hasPragma".}
##
## To enable the rule again, the pragma *ruleOn: "hasPragma"* should be added in
## the element which should be checked. For example, if the rule should be
## re-enabled for `const a = 1`, the full declaration should be::
##
##      const a = 1 {.ruleOn: "hasPragma".}
##
## Examples
## --------
##
## 1. Check if all procedures have declared pragma raises. It can be empty or
##    contains names of raised exception::
##
##      check hasPragma procedures "raises: [*"
##
## 2. Find all declarations with have *sideEffect* pragma declared::
##
##      search hasPragma all sideEffect
##
## 3. Count amount of procedures which don't have declared pragma *gcSafe*::
##
##      count not hasPragma procedures gcSafe
##
## 4. Check if all procedures have declared pragmas *contractual* and *lock*.
##    The *lock* pragma must have entered the level of the lock::
##
##      check hasPragma procedures contractual "lock: *"
