## The rule to check if all calls in the code uses named parameters
## The syntax in a configuration file is::
##
##   [ruleType] ?not? namedParams
##
## * ruleType is the type of rule which will be executed. Proper values are:
##   *check*, *search* and *count*. For more information about the types of
##   rules, please refer to the program's documentation. Check type will raise
##   an error if there is a call which doesn't have all parameters named.
##   Search type will list all calls which set all their parameters as named
##   and raise error if nothing was found. Count type will simply list the
##   amount of calls which set all their parameters as named.
## * optional word *not* means negation for the rule. Adding word *not* will
##   change to inform only about calls which have some parameters not named.
##
## Examples
## --------
##
## 1. Check if all calls in module set their parameters as named::
##
##     check namedParams
##
## 2. Search for all calls which don't set their parameters as named::
##
##     search not namedParams
