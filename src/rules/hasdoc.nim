## The rule to check if all public declarations (variables, procedures, etc)
## have documentation comments. It doesn't check public fields of types
## declarations for the documentation.
## The syntax in a configuration file is::
##
##   [ruleType] ?not? hasDoc
##
## * ruleType is the type of rule which will be executed. Proper values are:
##   *check*, *search* and *count*. For more information about the types of
##   rules, please refer to the program's documentation. Check type will raise
##   an error if there is a public declaration which doesn't have documentation.
##   Search type will list all public declarations which have documentation and
##   raise error if nothing was found. Count type will simply list the amount
##   of public declarations which have documentation.
## * optional word *not* means negation for the rule. Adding word *not* will
##   change to inform only about public declaration which have documentation.
##   Probably useable only with search and count type of rule.
## * hasDoc is the name of the rule. It is case-insensitive, thus it can be
##   set as *hasdoc*, *hasDoc* or *hAsDoC*.
##
## Disabling the rule
## ------------------
## It is possible to disable the rule for a selected part of the checked code
## by using pragma *ruleOff: "hasDoc"* in the element from which the rule
## should be disabled or in code before it. For example, if the rule should be
## disabled for procedure `proc main()`, the full declaration of it should be::
##
##     proc main () {.ruleOff: "hasDoc".}
##
## To enable the rule again, the pragma *ruleOn: "hasDoc"* should be added in
## the element which should be checked or in code before it. For example, if
## the rule should be re-enabled for `const a = 1`, the full declaration should
## be::
##
##     const a {.ruleOn: "hasDoc".} = 1
##
## Examples
## --------
##
## 1. Check if all public declarations in module have documentation::
##
##     check hasDoc
##
## 2. Search for all public declarations which don't have documentation::
##
##     search not hasDoc
