## The rule to check if all public declarations (variables, procedures, etc)
## have documentation comments
## The syntax in a configuration file is::
##
##   [ruleType] ?not? hasDoc
##
## * ruleType is the type of rule which will be executed. Proper values are:
##   *check*, *search* and *count*. For more information about the types of
##   rules, please refer to the program's documentation. Check type will raise
##   an error if there is a public declarations which doesn't have documentation.
##   Search type will list all public declarations which have documentation and
##   raise error if nothing was found. Count type will simply list the amount
##   of public declarations which have documentation.
## * optional word *not* means negation for the rule. Adding word *not* will
##   change to inform only about public declaration which have documentation.
##   Probably useable only with search and count type of rule.
##
## Examples
## --------
##
## 1. Check if all public declarations in module have documentation::
##
##     check hasDoc
##
## 2. Search for all public declarations which don't have documentation::
##
##     search not hasDoc
