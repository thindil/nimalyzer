## The rule to check if the declared procedures has side effects or not.
## The syntax in a configuration file is::
##
##   [ruleType] ?not? hasSideEffect
##
## * ruleType is the type of rule which will be executed. Proper values are:
##   *check*, *search*, *count* and *fix. For more information about the types of
##   rules, please refer to the program's documentation. --Insert description
##   how rules types works with the rule--.
## * optional word *not* means negation for the rule. Adding word *not* will
##   change to inform only about --Insert description how negation affects the
##   rule--.
## * hasSideEffect is the name of the rule. It is case-insensitive, thus it can be
##   set as *hassideeffect*, *hasSideEffect* or *hAsSiDeEfFeCt*.
##
## Disabling the rule
## ------------------
## It is possible to disable the rule for a selected part of the checked code
## by using pragma *ruleOff: "hasSideEffect"* in the declaration of the procedure
## from which the rule should be disabled or in code before it. For example, if
## the rule should be disabled for procedure `proc main()`, the full declaration
## of it should be::
##
##     proc main () {.ruleOff: "hasSideEffect".}
##
## To enable the rule again, the pragma *ruleOn: "hasSideEffect"* should be added in
## the declaration of the procedure which should be checked or in code before it.
## For example, if the rule should be re-enabled for `proc myProc()`, the full
## declaration should be::
##
##     proc myProc () {.ruleOn: "hasSideEffect".}
