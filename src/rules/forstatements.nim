## The rule to check do `for` statements in the code don't contain some
## expressions. At the moment, it can check only if the `for` statement iterator
## has or doesn't have the direct call to `pairs` or `items` iterators.
##
## The syntax in a configuration file is::
##
##   [ruleType] ?not? forStatements
##
## * ruleType is the type of rule which will be executed. Proper values are:
##   *check*, *search*, *count* and *fix*. For more information about the types of
##   rules, please refer to the program's documentation. Check type will raise
##   an error if there is a `for` statement which violates the check. Search
##   type will list all statements which violates the check or raise an
##   error if nothing found. Count type will simply list the amount of the
##   statements which violates the check. Fix type will try to fix the code
##   which violates check: it will add the direct call for proper iterator or
##   remove it, for negation type of the rule.
## * optional word *not* means negation for the rule. Adding word *not* will
##   change to inform only about the `for` statements which not violates the
##   rule's check.
## * forStatements is the name of the rule. It is case-insensitive, thus it can be
##   set as *forstatements*, *forStatements* or *fOrStAtEmEnTs*.
##
## Disabling the rule
## ------------------
## It is possible to disable the rule for a selected part of the checked code
## by using pragma *ruleOff: "forStatements"* in the code before it. For
## example, if the rule should be disabled for the selected statement, the full
## declaration of it should be::
##
##     {.ruleOff: "forStatements".}
##     for i in [1..5]:
##       echo i
##
## To enable the rule again, the pragma *ruleOn: "forStatements"* should be
## added in the code before it. For example, if the rule should be re-enabled
## for the statement, the full declaration should be::
##
##     {.ruleOn: "forStatements".}
##     for i in [1..5]:
##       echo i
##
## Examples
## --------
##
## 1. Check if all `for` statements have direct calls for iterators::
##
##     check forStatements
##
## 2. Remove all direct calls for iterators from `for` statements::
##
##     fix not forStatements
