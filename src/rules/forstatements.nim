## --Insert here the description of the rule--
## The syntax in a configuration file is::
##
##   [ruleType] ?not? forStatements
##
## * ruleType is the type of rule which will be executed. Proper values are:
##   *check*, *search*, *count* and *fix*. For more information about the types of
##   rules, please refer to the program's documentation. --Insert description
##   how rules types works with the rule--.
## * optional word *not* means negation for the rule. Adding word *not* will
##   change to inform only about --Insert description how negation affects the
##   rule--.
## * forStatements is the name of the rule. It is case-insensitive, thus it can be
##   set as *forstatements*, *forStatements* or *--rUlEnAmE--*.
##
## Disabling the rule
## ------------------
## It is possible to disable the rule for a selected part of the checked code
## by using pragma *ruleOff: "forStatements"* in the element from which the rule
## should be disabled or in code before it. For example, if the rule should
## be disabled for procedure `proc main()`, the full declaration of it should
## be::
##
##     proc main () {.ruleOff: "forStatements".}
##
## To enable the rule again, the pragma *ruleOn: "forStatements"* should be added in
## the element which should be checked or in code before it. For example, if
## the rule should be re-enabled for `const a = 1`, the full declaration should
## be::
##
##     const a {.ruleOn: "forStatements".} = 1
