## The rule to check if the selected procedure uses all its parameter
## The syntax in a configuration file is::
##
##   [ruleType] ?not? parametersUsed
##
## * ruleType is the type of rule which will be executed. Proper values are:
##   *check*, *search* and *count*. For more information about the types of
##   rules, please refer to the program's documentation. Check type will raise
##   an error if there is a procedure which doesn't use all its parameters.
##   Search type will list all procedures which uses their all parameters and
##   raise error if nothing was found. Count type will simply list the amount
##   of procedures which uses all their parameters.
## * optional word *not* means negation for the rule. Adding word *not* will
##   change to inform only about procedures which have all parameters used.
##   Probably useable only with search and count type of rule.
##
## Examples
## --------
##
## 1. Check if all procedures in module uses their parameters::
##
##     check parametersUsed
##
## 2. Search for all procedures which don't use their all parameters::
##
##     search not parametersUsed
