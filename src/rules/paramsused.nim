## The rule to check if the selected procedure uses all its parameter
## The syntax in a configuration file is::
##
##   [ruleType] ?not? paramsUsed [declarationType]
##
## * ruleType is the type of rule which will be executed. Proper values are:
##   *check*, *search*, *count* and *fix*. For more information about the types of
##   rules, please refer to the program's documentation. Check type will raise
##   an error if there is a procedure which doesn't use all its parameters.
##   Search type will list all procedures which uses their all parameters and
##   raise error if nothing was found. Count type will simply list the amount
##   of procedures which uses all their parameters. Fix type will execute the
##   default shell command set by the program's setting **fixCommand**.
## * optional word *not* means negation for the rule. Adding word *not* will
##   change to inform only about procedures which have all parameters used.
##   Probably useable only with search and count type of rule.
## * paramsUsed is the name of the rule. It is case-insensitive, thus it can be
##   set as *paramsUsed*, *paramsUsed* or *pArAmSuSeD*.
## * declarationType is the type of declaration which will be checked for the
##   parameters usage. Possible values: `procedures`: check all procedures,
##   functions and methods. `templates`: check templates only. `all`: check
##   all routines declarations (procedures, functions, templates, macros, etc.).
##
## Disabling the rule
## ------------------
## It is possible to disable the rule for a selected part of the checked code
## by using pragma *ruleOff: "paramsUsed"* in the declaration from which the rule
## should be disabled or in code before it. For example, if the rule should be
## disabled for procedure `main()`, the full declaration of it should be::
##
##      proc main() {.ruleOff: "paramsUsed".}
##
## To enable the rule again, the pragma *ruleOn: "paramsUsed"* should be added in
## the element which should be checked or in code before it. For example, if
## the rule should be re-enabled for function `myFunc(a: int)`, the full
## declaration should be::
##
##      func myFunc(a: int) {.ruleOn: "paramsUsed".}
##
## Examples
## --------
##
## 1. Check if all procedures in module uses their parameters::
##
##     check paramsUsed procedures
##
## 2. Search for all declarations which don't use their all parameters::
##
##     search not paramsUsed all
